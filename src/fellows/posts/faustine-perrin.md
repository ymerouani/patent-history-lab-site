Associate Professor in Economic History at Lund University. Researches gender, innovation, and long-run development. Her work focuses on women's empowerment and gender equality in innovation, examining the role of female inventors in the nineteenth-century French patent system and legal barriers to participation. Through cliometric analysis and extensive patent databases, she explores how technological knowledge spread through regional networks and the role of local institutions in fostering innovation during the industrialization period.
