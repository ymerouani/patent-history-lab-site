This project tackles a fundamental challenge in historical data work: identifying unique individuals across hundreds of thousands of archival records. Beginning with the French Patent Database, 1791–1900, which contains roughly 390,000 patents but offers no way to distinguish repeat inventors, we reshape the data into approximately 448,000 inventor–patent observations and classify them into four entity types requiring distinct linking strategies: male individuals, female individuals, family firms, and non-family firms. Firms prove most tractable, relying on stable naming conventions and assumptions about organizational longevity. Individual inventors present greater difficulties, with women's records complicated by surname changes upon marriage and men's records posing a massive scale problem. To address chronic gaps in first-name data, we turn directly to original patent applications: manually transcribing names for female inventors and deploying an ensemble of vision-based large language models to extract first names from over 150,000 handwritten documents, reducing missingness from 65 to 33 percent. For male inventors, we develop a four-stage pipeline combining deterministic rules for obvious cases, a Fellegi–Sunter probabilistic model that weights the informativeness of shared features, modern language model embeddings to capture semantic similarities invisible to rule-based systems, and a fine-tuned RoBERTa model trained on deliberately degraded data. A final clustering stage respects hard constraints while merging candidates into coherent inventor identities, transforming scattered patent filings into a credible reconstruction of distinct inventors across more than a century of French innovation.
