Who were the women who invented in 19th and early 20th century France? Their names appear in patent archives, but little else—no birth dates, no family backgrounds, no life stories. We set out to change that. By developing a novel record-linking methodology, we traced over 500 female inventors from sparse patent filings back to their full demographic histories: when and where they were born, whom they married, and when they died. The challenge was formidable. France has no centralized digitized civil registry, and these women's records are scattered across thousands of local archives. Our solution combines automated searches of genealogical databases with a sophisticated matching algorithm that weighs name similarities, geographic clues, and source reliability to identify the right person among dozens of potential matches. The result is unprecedented: verified life histories for hundreds of women whose inventive contributions had been reduced to mere names on paper. For the first time, we can ask not just what these women invented, but who they were—and how their circumstances shaped their creativity.
